PageRank is an algorithm used by google search to rank websites in their search engine results. Google use web crawler to grad many url, and PageRank is an algorithm for them to show the result to users. PageRank is not self-rank. It ranks based on others. More important websites are more likely to receive more links from other websites and website with higher page rank will pass higher weight. Dealt with wiki database, I built transition matrix based on links receiving from other websites. updated PageRank matrix by multiply it with transition matrix for several times and gained the final PageRank matrix which represents the likelihood for a person to click these websites.
